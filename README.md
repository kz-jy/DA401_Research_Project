With plentiful studies on suicide, scholars determine that even after receiving treatment of mental health, the risk of suicide still exists. Therefore, the research aims to first explore the influencing factors of suicide risk and find out if there is any relationship between two influencing factors, and then build a model to effectively classify the suicide risk which can be used for improving the suicide prevention project.
